# 🏠 House Price Analysis using Python

This project explores the **factors influencing house prices** through visual exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a housing dataset. It breaks down the dataset feature by feature — including house area, number of bedrooms, condition, and more — to find meaningful patterns and relationships.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how different attributes of houses affect their prices. It uses **Python's data analysis and visualization libraries** to generate insights in an easy-to-understand graphical form. This analysis serves as a strong foundation for future predictive modeling and business decision-making in the real estate domain.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Advanced statistical plots
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive analysis

## 📊 Visual Analysis

The project includes the following visual explorations:

1. **Distribution of House Area (sqft)**  
   Histogram showing how house sizes are spread across the dataset.

2. **Relationship Between Price and Living Area**  
   Scatter plot exploring how house size affects pricing, also highlighting waterfront properties.

3. **Distribution of Houses Based on Condition**  
   Pie chart showing the count of houses grouped by their physical condition (1–5).

4. **Relationship Between Price and Condition**  
   Line graph analyzing how average prices vary across condition levels.

5. **Relationship Between Bedrooms and Price**  
   Strip plot analyzing pricing trends across different bedroom counts and house conditions.

6. **Distribution of Price Based on Floors**  
   Violin plot to see how floor levels influence house prices.

Each visualization was created with custom color palettes and styling for better clarity and presentation.

## 📈 Key Findings

- Most houses are in **average to good condition**, and better conditions tend to have higher prices.
- **Living area and condition** show a more direct impact on price compared to bedrooms or floor count.
- Properties with **fewer or more than average bedrooms/floors** may show unexpected price variations, indicating the presence of other influencing factors.
- **Outliers** exist in almost every category and could represent luxury homes or anomalies.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The analysis shows that **no single factor alone determines house pricing**. Instead, a combination of factors like **condition, area, and possibly location** interact to set the value. Visual EDA helps uncover such complex patterns that can guide pricing strategy, investment, and development.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Building **machine learning models** for price prediction.
- Adding **geolocation-based analysis** using maps.
- Creating **interactive dashboards** with tools like Plotly or Tableau.
- Correlating house price with **external economic factors** (e.g., interest rates, location amenities).
- Segmenting customers using **clustering algorithms** to identify buyer personas.
